# Algorithmic Efficiency Project
### The project takes command line arguments A for Add, RO for remove one, RA for Remove all, S for Search
    - e.g S item would return the number occurences of the element in the node 
## So We have implemented, 
  - Balance Tree
  - Balance Search Tree
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Sorted Doubly Linked List
  - Hash maps
## Plan 
- All implementations support Addition, Remove One, Remove all instances of one element and Search.
- The plan is to run multiple tests with different Multisets length
## For example a sample test would be
### Scenario 1
- 100 Adds, 100 removes, and 50 searches
### Scenario 2
- 1000 adds, 1000 remove All's, 1000 Searches 
### Scenario 3
- 10000 Adds, 1000 Removes, 1000 Remove All's, 1000 Searches

etc..

The Efficiency results will not be posted, but you can use this project to run these tests and find out your self.
